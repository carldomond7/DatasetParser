They are almost completely covered by yellow fur. They have long yellow ears that are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its large tail is notable for being shaped like a lightning bolt, yet its brown tip is almost always forgotten.\nSquirtle: Shoots water at prey while in water. Withdraws into its shell when in danger. Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.","output":"- Pokemon Winner\nSquirtle's Water-type advantage over Pikachu's Electric type could give it a significant edge.\n\nWhile Pikachu is known for its speed and Electric-type attacks, Squirtle's Water-type moves are super effective against Electric-type Pokémon.\n\nType Advantage: Water-type moves deal double damage to Electric-type Pokémon, giving Squirtle a clear advantage in a one-on-one battle.\nDefensive Stance: Squirtle's defensive capabilities, such as using Water Gun to counter Electric attacks or Shellder to protect itself, can also help it withstand Pikachu's assaults.\nHowever, as with any Pokémon battle, factors like individual levels, movesets, and strategies can influence the outcome. Pikachu's speed and agility could potentially pose a threat if Squirtle is unable to land its Water-type attacks."}]]
